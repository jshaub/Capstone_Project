An individual uses the friend finder service by initially requesting an account corresponding to their Penn State University E-mail address by submitting the form on the sign-up page. After verifying their ownership of the e-mail address by clicking the verification link in the message received at the e-mail address that was provided, the user can navigate to the log-in page to begin using the service. The user should fill out the forms on the account details page to provide the system with information which it can use to match the individual with other users on the recommendations page. The recommendations page provides a list of users which are suspected matches for the active user. The user can choose to send a friend request to any individual in the recommendation queue by selecting the appropriate option for the corresponding entry in the queue. Afterward, the user corresponding the recommendation entry is notfied on their friends page of the pending request. This other user can choose to either accept or dismiss the pending request. Whenever a pending request is dismissed, the request is removed from the user's in-comming requests and the initiator's out-going requests; when a request is accepted, both users will appear on the friend list of the other user. At this point, the system enables the users to communicate through the instant messaging feature by selecting the appropriate action from the entry on the friends page. Additionally, this page provides the user with the option to remove any of the listed friends.

The "Friend Finder" service implements a basic account system which allows individuals to register for an account using an email address and a password. These credentials are required to authenticate the user in the log-in webpage whenever the user returns to the site. The service verifies the credientials comparing the salted hash values for the password of the user account corresponding to the unique email address. The user is automatically deauthenticated after the user has not interacted with the page for a while. The active user is determined by installing a cookie in the browser which provides a temporary key for the log-in session.
